# Snowflake-Snowpro
##### 1_hands_on - This is a SQL script that uses role-based access control (RBAC) and privilege management in Snowflake. It creates a new database, schema, and table, defines a custom role with various privileges, and assigns a new user to the role. It also shows how to grant and revoke privileges and automate privilege management with future grants. The script can be used as a template for RBAC in Snowflake.
##### 2_hands_on - This code demonstrates how to manage masking policies and row access policies in Snowflake, a cloud-based data warehousing platform. It also shows how to implement centralized policy management. The script creates a database, schema, and table for test data, defines roles with various privileges, and creates and applies masking and row access policies on the table. Finally, the script creates a mapping table and uses it to implement a more complex row access policy.
